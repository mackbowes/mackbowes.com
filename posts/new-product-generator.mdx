This one is mostly for me.

I want to make ecommerce websites and win awwwards for having distinct and well thought out designs, along the lines of [recess](https://takearecess.com/), [ugly drinks](https://uglydrinks.com/), or [munjoi](https://munjoi.com/).

These websites have a common thread - they have a super specific market segment they're going after. A market segment that has clear and specific values, goals, and prefers a very specific aesthetic, and the product is used as a vehicle for the audience to achieve true authenticity.

To that end, I created a brand/product generator that spits out a product, an defines an audience by their preferred color, the personal values they hold, and specific aesthetics that they enjoy. These four things together produce unique and underserved market segments that are practically guaranteed to earn sales, providing your design skills can connect the audience to that aesthetic through web design, graphic design, packaging, and overall branding.
