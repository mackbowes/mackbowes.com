## Read N Respond 1: Shopify Partner Academy Sales Fundamentals

Read N Respond is basically just a series of note-taking. It's partially for me to have something to do with my ADHD little hands while I'm reading technical documentation...

...obviously we're starting with something easy today...

...and partially to leave behind a record / body of work for potential clients and/or employers to review later.

There's also the potential for, when I hit my stride, these free-wheeling documents to get indexed by big G and maybe someone researching my same topics can follow in my wake!
